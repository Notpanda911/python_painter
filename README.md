# About
called "Click2Draw", this program uses a pygame window embeded inside a tkinter window. 
as of version 0.5 the code is still pretty ineffcient and messy but i hope to fix those in the future

# Acknowledgement
this was made for a final project in a 3 people but ive done most of the coding. 
To stay transparent - the parts i have not done are as follows:
> Creating the pygame and tkinter frames/windows and then embedding it, 
> creating choose_color() and Cpicklabel
> and other small stuff like choosing the font, color
